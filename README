This Rails app allows users to sign up, and then to enter in up to three phone numbers. The specifications said to allow arbitrary numbers of phone numbers, but I decided to add in a limit because that would improve the app were it to actually be deployed; I don't want to be spending ridiculous sums on twilio messaging. 

The frontend code is styled using Twitter Bootstrap. Currently all form validation is backend, i hope to add some frontend javascript validation. The app is designed to be safe from mass assignment attack and its sign-in is designed to be secure. 

To run the server, simply cd in and use rails s. You will need rails 3.2.
